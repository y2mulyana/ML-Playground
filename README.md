# Data Science & Machine Learning Repository

Welcome to my personal Data Science and Machine Learning repository! ðŸš€

This repository is a collection of various projects, exercises, and experiments focused on honing my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling. It serves as a portfolio to track my learning journey and showcase the techniques and algorithms I've worked with.

## Purpose

This repo is intended to:
- **Practice and experiment** with different machine learning models and techniques.
- **Explore real-world datasets** and extract meaningful insights using data science methodologies.
- **Improve problem-solving skills** through challenges in data wrangling, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

## Skills and Topics Covered

- Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
- Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning
- Time Series Forecasting
- Deep Learning (Neural Networks, CNNs, etc.)

## Key Features

- Jupyter Notebooks for clear, reproducible analysis (most of it developed in Jupyter nitebook under Windows).
- Visualizations using libraries like `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`.
- Use of popular libraries such as `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, `keras`, and more.

## Why This Repository?

This repository is not just about personal growth, but also serves as a **real-world demonstration of my data science and machine learning skills**. Whether you're a recruiter or a fellow enthusiast, feel free to explore the work, provide feedback, or even collaborate on future projects!
